Create a new class called MethodTraining.java and in this class please do the following:

    1) Demonstrate method overloading in this class

    2) Demonstrate the difference between "pass by value" and "pass by reference"

    3) Create a method that will return the largest of 4 numbers (all of which are passed in as arguments)

    4) Write a method to count all consonants (the opposite of vowels) in a String

    5) Write a method that will determine whether or not a number is prime

    6) Write a method that will return a small array containing the highest and lowest numbers in a given numeric array,
            which is passed in as an argument

    7) Write a method that takes 3 arguments (int maxNum, int divisor1, int divisor2) and returns an Integer Arraylist.
        In this method create an Integer ArrayList and populate it with each number between zero and maxNum that is
        divisible by both divisor1 and divisor2. Then return this ArrayList. After calling this method, print out the
        length of the returned list


    8) Write a method that will reverse an array in place use only one extra temp variable. For this exercise you cannot
        instantiate a second array. You must reverse the array in place using only one extra temp variable. Hint: this
        variable is used to temporarily store individual values in the array

            nums[i] = nums[nums.length - i - 1];
            nums[nums.length - i - 1] = temp;
